\section{Significant Results}

%This section is basically a summary of the previous section. Summarize the main findings of the project here. At any point of time in the course of the project, if you get a significant result which you think is one of the important findings of the project, copy it from previous section to this section (copy-paste, not cut-paste).

%The main advantage of this section is that, you can comment out the previous section at any point and then you have a nice summary of the project (which could be used to explain the project to others).
