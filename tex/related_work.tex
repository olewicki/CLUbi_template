\section{Most Related Work}

%You should maintain a list of most related work to the project. This is not like the related work section in conference papers (even though we will use this section to write the related work section in the resulting conference paper). If you add a paper in this section, it means that you have read that paper in detail. To maintain a list of papers related to the project that you want to read in future, see \textit{literature.tex}.
%
%You should have a subsection for each related paper. I have given a sample subsection here. Follow the same format.
