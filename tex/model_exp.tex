\section{Model and Experiments}

%This section is a mix of models and experiments. This is the main section of the report which will log the entire research process. You will write down the precise description of the model, experiment design, results, graphs, analysis of results, next set of experiments, and so on.
%
%As the model evolves over time, do not edit the already described model. Write a new version of the model. Treat this section as a research log. Not as a research paper.
%
%Use the images folder to put all your images. Use \textit{meetings.tex} to maintain a log of all the project meetings and weekly to-do list.
